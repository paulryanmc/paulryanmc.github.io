Compiling C++ varies based on your compiler of choice and operating system.

Example command line for Windows with MinGW: g++ <.cpp files>

Example command line for Linux with gcc: gcc program-source-code.c -o executable-file-name

IDEs often come with built-in compilers. Consult your IDE's material.
