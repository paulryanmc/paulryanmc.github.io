To properly utilize these files, combine the relevant classes into a .jar file through a dedicated program or command line.

Example command line:

jar cf jar-file input-file(s)

In an IDE such as Netbeans, the process should more or less done for you during the build process, or can be quickly done by importing the classes.
Consult the material for your IDE.
